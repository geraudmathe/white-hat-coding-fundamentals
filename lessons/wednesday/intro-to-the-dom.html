        <h2>What is the DOM?</h2>
        <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It provides a **structured representation** of the document and it defines a way that the structure can be accessed from programs so that they can change the document structure, style and content.</p>

        <p>The DOM provides a representation of the document as a structured group of nodes and objects that have **properties** and **methods**. </p>

        <p>Essentially, the DOM connects web pages to scripts or programming languages.</p>

        <h2>What is a Web page?</h2>
        <p>A Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window, or as the HTML source. But it is the **same document** in both cases.</p>

        <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) provides another way to represent, store and manipulate that same document. The DOM is a fully **object-oriented representation** of the web page, and it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.</p>

        <p>The [W3C DOM](http://www.w3.org/DOM/) standard forms the basis of the DOM implemented in most modern browsers. Many browsers offer extensions beyond the W3C standard, so care must be exercised when using them on the web where documents may be accessed by various browsers with different DOMs.</p>

        <h2>A Tree?</h2>
        <p>The DOM represents a document as a tree. The tree is made up of parent-child relationships, a parent can have one or many children nodes.</p>

        <h2>Use a DOM object in Javascript</h2>
        <p>
          We can access any HTML tag in the document using javascript and the `document` object:
        </p>
        <code>
          document.getElementById("any_id_of_any_element")
        </code>

        <p>
          Then it is possible to change this javascript object's properties, and the changes will be reflected in the HTML:
        </p>

        <pre>
        <code>
        var element = document.getElementById("cat");
        => undefined

        element.innerHTML = "I'm a cat";
        element.style.backgroundColor = "red";
        element.style.border = "2px green solid";

        <h2>Create a DOM Object</h2>
        <p>
          You can also create elements using the DOM using <code> document.createElement(tagName);</code>
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        var element = document.createElement('h2');
        => undefined

        element
        => returns h2
        ```
        </code> </pre>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Create a DOM object</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>element is the created element object.</li>
          <li>tagName is a string that specifies the type of element to be created. The nodeName of the created element is initialized with the value of <code>tagName</code>. Don't use qualified names (like "<code>html:a</rcode>") with this method.</li>
        </ul>

  ## Create a DOM object (15 mins)


  #### Add onto the page

  ```js
  element.innerHTML = "Elephant";
  ```

  ```js
  var parent = document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0];
  parent.appendChild(element);
  ```

  - `parent` is the parent element.
  - `element` is the child node to append. Also returned.

  ## Different ways of accessing DOM elements

  There are a lot of different properties and method of a [DOM Element Object](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_all.asp).

  ### Accessing by ID

  Returns a reference to the element by its ID.

  ```js
  document.getElementById(id);
  ```

  ### Accessing by Class Names

  Returns an array of all child elements which have all of the given class names. This is not supported from IE8 and below, so be careful when using it.

  ```js
  var elements = document.getElementsByClassName(names);
  ```

  - `elements` is a `HTMLCollection` of found elements.
  - `names` is a string representing the list of class names to match; class names are separated by whitespace
  - `getElementsByClassName` can be called on any element, not only on the document. The element on which it is called will be used as the root of the search.

  An example:

  ```js
  var mice = document.getElementsByClassName('mouse');
  ```

  ### Accessing by Tag Name

  Returns an HTMLCollection of elements with the given HTML tag name. The complete document is searched, including the root node.

  ```js
  var elements = document.getElementsByTagName(name);
  ```

  - `elements` is a live HTMLCollection of found elements in the order they appear in the tree.
  - `name` is a string representing the name of the elements. The special string "*" represents all elements.

  An example:

  ```js
  var divs = document.getElementsByTagName('div');
  ```

  ### Accessing First Found Selector

  Returns the first element within the document (using depth-first pre-order traversal of the document's nodes) that matches the specified group of selectors. Supported by IE8 and up.

  ```js
  document.querySelector(selectors);
  ```

  - `element` is an element object.
  - `selectors` is a string containing one or more CSS selectors separated by commas.

  In this example, the first element in the document with the class "mouse" is returned:

  ```js
  var firstMouse = document.querySelector('.mouse');
  ```

  ### Accessing an Array of Selectors

  Returns a list of the elements within the document that match the specified group of selectors. The object returned is a NodeList. Supported by IE8 and up.

  ```js
  var elementList = document.querySelectorAll(selectors);
  ```

  - `elementList` is a non-live NodeList of element objects.
  - `selectors` is a string containing one or more CSS selectors separated by commas.

  This example returns a list of all elements within the document with either a class of "mouse" or id of "cat":

  ```js
  var matches = document.querySelectorAll(".mouse, #cat");
  ```

  ## Setting and getting elements attributes and content

  Once we have fetched an element using one of the above methods, we can

  ### Styling an HTML Element.

  The `HTMLElement.style` property is an object that represents the element's style attribute. To get the values of all CSS properties for an element you should use `window.getComputedStyle()` instead.

  ```js
  element.style.color = "#ff3300";
  element.style.marginTop = "30px";
  element.style.paddingBottom = "30px";
  ```

  ### Getting and Setting the HTML Elements.

  `innerHTML` sets or gets the HTML syntax describing the element's descendants.

  ```js
  // get the HTML of "element"
  var content = element.innerHTML;

  // set the HTML of "otherElement"
  otherElement.innterHTML = content;
  ```

  ###Getting and Setting the Class Name.

  `className` gets and sets the value of the class attribute of the specified element.

  ```js
  // get the class name of "element"
  var cName = element.className;

  // set the class name of "otherElement"
  otherElement.className = cName;

  // gets all classes set on the element "otherElement"
  otherElement.classList;

  // adds and removes classes from an element
  element.classList.add("new-class");
  element.classList.remove("new-class");

  // toggles a class
  element.classList.toggle("toggle-class");
  ```

  ###Getting and Setting the ID.

  Gets or sets the element's identifier (attribute id).

  ```js
  // get the id of "element"
  var idStr = element.id;

  // set the id of "otherElement"
  otherElement.id = idStr;
  ```
