          <h2>Text Flow using CSS 3</h2>

          <p>With HTML you can organize content into separate section, but what can you do if you want content to flow from one region to</p> another?
          <p>CSS Regions are sections of a document where content can flow from one region to another</p>
          <p>If there is too much content in one section, then the remaining content automatically flows into another region</p>
        </section>

          <h2>CSS Regions</h2>
          <p>Creating a CSS Region, you must specify a content source and content containers</p>
          <p>You set up CSS regions with the flow-into and flow-from properties</p>
          <p>A content source is a chunk of text that holds the content you want to flow through the regions</p>
          <p>Content containers are the areas where you want your content to appear</p>
          <p>You should use a separate HTML document as the source</p>
        </section>

					CSS allows you to create columns and divide content among them
this is called the multi-column layout
There are three primary CSS properties that you can use to manipulate columns:
column-count
column-gap
column-rule
In the CSS Box, columns are in between the content and the Box
