          <p class="small fragment fade-left">The server deals with the request and sends back a response in a series of 'packets'. Each packet is sent on the quickest route possible (not always the same) to reach the computer.</p>
          <p class="small fragment fade-left">As these packets can arrive at different times, each one contains instructions for the computer in order to put them back together to create the web page.</p>

          <h1>WHAT IS CSS</h1>
          <p>
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This means that styles are
            applied in a cascade, with styles declared lower down in the file
            taking precedence over earlier styles (all else being equal).

          <h2>WAYS OF WRITING CSS</h2>
          <p>There are four ways to style content on your website. These are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Using a style tag</li>
            <li>Using the style attribute</li>
            <li>Using JavaScript to style content</li>
            <li>Linking to an external stylesheet</li>

            <h2>Where to link?</h2>
            <p>
              It is always best to link to your stylesheet(s) in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag.
              This is so that the styles are loaded before the content is rendered.

            <h2>File paths</h2>
            <p>
              There are two ways to link to a file. One is by using a 'relative'
              path and the other is using an 'absolute' path.
            </p>
            <p>
              Anybody know the difference?
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Relative path</h2>
            <p>
              Relative paths take into account the location of the file the
              code is written in. It then allows for a path to be outlined
              from the file where the declaration is made, to the file where
              the link is being made.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a specific syntax to use when writing relative paths:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>'.' denotes the current working directory</li>
              <li>'..' means to jump back one level to the parent directory</li>
              <li>'/' is used to show where a file/directory name begins and ends</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Absolute path</h2>
            <p>
              An absolute path can either be a path that is absolute on the current drive/server
              or a full URL. Below is an example of an absolute path using the full URL to point
              to the image at a 3rd party site (not recommended).

            <h2>Absolute path (cont.)</h2>
            <p>
              As mentioned before, the other type of absolute path is absolute according
              to the file structure on your current drive/server.

                <p class="small">
                  <code>.png</code> Supports transparency and semi-transparency,
                  great for logos, icons, and repeating background tiles.

              <li class="fragment">
                <p class="small">
                  <code>.jpeg</code> No transparency, can be stored at different
                  compression levels with varying amounts of "lossy-ness", typically
                  the best format for photos. (Try to balance between photo quality
                  and file size.)
                </p>
              </li>

                <p class="small">
                  <code>.gif</code> Can have basic transparency and can cycle through
                  a number of images, providing an animated asset.

            <h2>File naming</h2>
            <p>
              It is useful to develop a consistent strategy for naming files.
              Here are some good guidelines to start implementing:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Never use spaces when naming a file.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Use either '-' or '_' to separate words. It doesn't matter which,
                  but be consistent.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Use only lowercased letters.
                </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              As a rule of thumb, CSS code is easiest to manage
              when your selectors are specific enough to target the required
              element, but not so specific that there may be knock-on consequences
              for other, similar elements.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is because more specific selector chains will override less
              specific ones.

            <p>
              Some CSS styles can be handed down from the parent element to

            </p>
            <p>
              You can find out which CSS properties are inherited by checking
              the 'inherited' column in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/propidx.html">this</a>
              W3C table.

            <h2>CSS lengths (cont.)</h2>
            <p>
              The different types of CSS length units include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Absolute units</li>
              <li>Relative units</li>
              <li>Viewport percentage lengths</li>
              <li>Percentage</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I will only be touching on the main units. If you would like to
              read up on them all, then <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-lengths-of-css/" target="_blank">here</a>
              is a great article written by Chris Coyier.

            <h2>Absolute units</h2>
            <p>
              By far the most commonly used absolute unit is the pixel (px).
            </p>
            <p>
              Once an element has an explicit pixel <code>width</code> or
              <code>height</code> assigned to it, it will never change size
              based on unit changes elsewhere in the code or based on screen
              size.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Relative units</h2>
            <p>
              The two most common relative units are <code>em</code> and
              <code>rem</code> units.
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>em</code> units are calculated as a multiple of the closest
              ancestor with an explicit <code>font-size</code> declaration.
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>rem</code> units are expressed as a multiple of the root
              element (the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element).
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's go back to our inheritance <a href="https://codepen.io/gerrymathe/pen/GdREZq" target="_blank">Codepen</a>
              to work through it.

            <h2>Viewport percentage lengths</h2>
            <p>
              <code>vh</code> and <code>vw</code> can be used to set an element's
              size relative to a percentage of the viewport. Both are used
              by writing a value of between 0-100 before expressing the unit
              e.g. <code>70vh</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>vh</code> is a percentage value of the height of the viewport.
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>vw</code> is a percentage value of the width of the viewport.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Percentage</h2>
            <p>
              Element dimensions can also be declared as a <code>%</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              An element's percentage will define its dimensions in relation
              to its parent element.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, if the parent container has a width of 500px and the
              child's width is set to 50%, the width of the child will be 250px.

            <h2>CSS colors (yep that's how to spell it in CSS!)</h2>
            <p>
              When declaring colours in CSS, there are 6 different options
              available to you:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Keyword</li>
              <li>Hex code</li>
              <li>RGB</li>
              <li>RGBa</li>
              <li>HSL</li>
              <li>HSLa</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Keyword</h2>
            <p>
              As you have already seen, there are some keywords for CSS colours,
              such as <code>black</code>, <code>white</code>, <code>red</code>.
              Or if you want to go very random: <code>blanchedalmond</code>,
              <code>palegoldenrod</code>, <code>peachpuff</code>, <code>whitesmoke</code>,
              or my personal favourite <code>papayawhip</code>.
            </p>

            <h2>Hex</h2>
            <p>
              Hex code values range from 0 (lowest) to F (highest) with the
              first two numbers representing red, the second two green and the
              final two blue.
            </p>
            <img src="../../images/colors-hex.png" alt="Hex code colour diagram">
            <p>
              This is the only colour unit where you can be really sad (like me)
              and create words out of colour codes...<code>#BADA55</code>!
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>RGB and RGBa</h2>
            <p>
              RGB is written as 3 values ranging from 0-255. The first unit is
              for red, second for green and third for blue e.g. <code>rgb(0,100,0)</code> would
              be a dark-ish green.
            </p>
            <p>
              RGBa is the same as RGB, only a fourth value is added ranging from 0-1.
              This unit represents transparency with 0 being fully transparent and
              1 being solid e.g. <code>rgba(0,100,0, 0.5)</code> would be the same colour as before,
              but slightly transparent.
            </p>

            <h2>HSL and HSLa</h2>
            <p>
              HSL is typically the least used colour unit in CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
              The numbers correspond to the hue, saturation and lightness of the
              colour. Hue is expressed as a degree angle measure. Saturation is
              expressed as a percentage, with 100% being a fully saturated color,
              and 0% being a shade of gray (no hue). Lightness is also expressed
              as a percentage, 0% being black, and 100% being white.
            </p>

                  Always link to an external stylesheet

              <li>
                <p>
                  CSS stands for Cascading Stylesheets, meaning styles are applied
                  in a cascade. Therefore (all else being equal) the final declaration
                  on an element will be applied.
                </p>
